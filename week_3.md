# Week 3 Summary
We had our second meeting this week with my research supervisor Lachlan Andrew, and my research partner Adolphus Lee. This week we discussed about h

## Goals completed since last week
As planned, we are still working on converting the MATLAB code into Python. On looking into several methods for edge detection, we researched on specific methods of machine learning including classification for images, decision trees, logic regression models, Long Short Term Memory, and LASSO. While some of these can be used to detect the plunges or surges of electricity, some would not be useful.

## Meeting and Research conducted
Both me and Adolphus have looked into and understood the datasets. We explored different machine learning techniques and probed into the implementation details of different models and implementations. We are researching to detect edges in two possible ways. The first way is to use the images generated from the datasets using image recognition, alternatively we can use the value datasets in order to understand the values that cause the edges to form. 

## Image Recognition Techniques
###  Edge Detection librares in MATLAB
I was exploring MATLAB built in functions to try to detect edges in our intensity image, and we used Canny and Prewitt methods. However, the following image shows the results, which are very bad at understanding the horizontal edges in the default image.

## Goals before next meeting
Since we could not properly work on converting the MATLAB code into Python this week, this will still be our top most priority for next week's goals. Also, we aim to probe further down our research into detecting edges using LSTM or Image classifiers. We will keep on implementing new things to try to get the most optimal results. However, we will be showing all of our progress to Lachlan on our next meeting.
