# Week 2 Summary
I had my first meeting with week with my research supervisor Lachlan Andrew, and my research partner Adolphus Lee. Together, we will be working on a project called 'What edge is not an edge?'

## Project Details
Our research project is to detect sudden surge or plunge of electricity consumption by going through household electrivity consumption datasets by half hours obtained over a year. These sudden surges and plunges are difficult to detect, especially considering that there are small changes that has to be filtered out, and some edges are not registered as edges on computers. Our work is to get these edge identification accurate so that the edges are detected from any household dataset.

## Meeting and Research conducted
This week, we are given a sample MATLAB code by Lachlan that can detect edges of the electricity consumption dataset, however this code is to be converted to Python, and major changes have to be made so that the code can detect edges accurately. The tasks are divided between myself and Adolphus, where I will be working on converting the MATLAB code into Python, and Adolphus will be working on finding new ways of calculating and detecting the edges accurately. However, since the code is very large and that I am not familiar with MATLAB codes, Adolphus is helping me out to write the Python script for edge detection.

## Goals before next meeting
Before next week's meeting with Lachlan, we plan to complete our MATLAB code conversion to Python, and will look into several methods for edge detection other than just using standard deviation and mean values of data. I also aim to research on image detection algorithms or using machine learning to detect the plunges or surges of electricity, however, the path I would further research on would be decided by Lachlan once I discuss ideas with him next meeting.
