# Week 7 Summary
This week, we had our last meeting with Lachlan. Unfortunately, he is not going to be continuing as our supervisor. Dr. Mahsa Salehi has been appointed as our new supervisor.

## Goals completed since last week
Since I was allocated to research on Machine Learning techniques that can be implemented, I read documentation on Regression Analysis and LSTM, while Adolphus came up with successful outcomes at attempts on improving our statistical model of detecting edges.

## Goals before next meeting
Our main goal next week is to settle with our new supervisor, to explain our progress and get new objectives in order to proceed our research. Since we already have successful outcomes through our statistical analysis, we will focus more on the Machine Learning part of our research. Based on our Project Specification, we will be conducting Machine Learning Techniques on the same dataset and try to obtain accurate results. We will then be spending the rest of the time in running tests to compare our statistical model vs Machine Learning in order to present the more accurate option to choose in our dataset.
