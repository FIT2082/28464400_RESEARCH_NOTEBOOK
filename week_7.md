# Week 7 Summary
This week, we had our last meeting with Lachlan. Unfortunately, he is not going to be continuing as our supervisor. Dr. Mahsa Salehi has been appointed as our new supervisor.

## Goals completed since last week
Since I was allocated to research on Machine Learning techniques that can be implemented, I read documentation on Regression Analysis and LSTM, while Adolphus came up with successful outcomes at attempts on improving our statistical model of detecting edges.

## Research conducted on Machine Learning Techniques


## Research conducted on Statistical Model

The following diagram is the successful model Adolphus worked on throughout this week:

After a going through a lot of test samples, we have decided to use Median filter for filtration of noises. Improvements were made so that the lines do not extend too much to show incorrect areas as edges. Also, smaller lines of size from 0 to 20 were removed from the image to show clear areas of edges, because most edges extend over 20 days.

The model has been tested on most of our datasets, and it gave accurate results for most of our tested intensity graphs. Based on that, we are very assured that the model will work on most of the datasets, and Lachlan was very happy to see our results. Therefore we will focus more on Machine learning techhniques such as regression modelling from now on.


## Goals before next meeting
Our main goal next week is to settle with our new supervisor, to explain our progress and get new objectives in order to proceed our research. Since we already have successful outcomes through our statistical analysis, we will focus more on the Machine Learning part of our research. Based on our Project Specification, we will be conducting Machine Learning Techniques on the same dataset and try to obtain accurate results. We will then be spending the rest of the time in running tests to compare our statistical model vs Machine Learning in order to present the more accurate option to choose in our dataset.
