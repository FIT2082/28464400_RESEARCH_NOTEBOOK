## 'What edge is not an edge?' - Project Details
Our research project is to detect sudden surge or plunge of electricity consumption by going through household electrivity consumption datasets by half hours obtained over a year. These sudden surges and plunges are difficult to detect, especially considering that there are small changes that has to be filtered out, and some edges are not registered as edges on computers. Our work is to get these edge identification accurate so that the edges are detected from any household dataset.
