# Week 12 Summary
As planned, most of this week has been spent on creating the Poster, and discussing about the elevated pitch and presentation. The poster is already completed and we have visualized our Statistical Model that gave amazing results, and our Machine Learning algorithm that gives an accuracy of 68%.

## Goals completed since last week
Our priority for this week was to wrap up Statistical and ML model, and complete the poster file.

## Final Comments
We could successfully complete all the tasks as per the planning and the proposed timeline. With further improvements and possibilities of our research, there are potential to improve heuristics for statistical analysis, and to get better accuracy in ML results which can be done by adding more parameters and storing the training dataset collectively to store large training data. A better accuracy algorithm can be constructed using ROC curve as discussed with Dr. Mahsa, but due time constraints it remained beyond the scope of the research. Manually adding more validation data would be very beneficial to test variety of datasets using our models. 

Until week 14, me and Adolphus will be working on completing the Final Report for our project.
