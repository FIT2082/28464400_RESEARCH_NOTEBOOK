# Week 8 Summary
We had our first meeting with Dr. Mahsa Salehi, our new Research Supervisor. While most of the meeting was explaining the current status of the project and the work we have been doing, we made plans for the next four weeks of the semester.

## Goals completed since last week
Our Statistical Model is finally complete with acceptable accurate results in most of the datasets provided, and hence we have considered the task of building a statistical model to detect edges to be complete.

## Research Conducted
Since we did not have any specific guidelines towards what we should be doing in week 8, very little work has been done on Research, and we spent most of our times doing assignments of other units. 

However, in our research meeting, which was at the end of the week, Dr. Mahsa Salehi suggested on what we should do in the next two weeks. She suggested implementing a timeseries forecasting Machine Learning algorithm would be the best approach to our problem. She explained the basic mechanism of how autoregressive models work, and how it can potentially help us with great results in our case. She also gave us a book which explains how the model works beautifully. She also explained how LSTM works and might be useful for our analysis, however, since LSTM is advanced in terms of implementation and consider us not having any prior experience in Machine Learning, we decided that the best way to go around it is to spend time and implement Autoregressive Model properly.

We also sketched out an updated timeline of our tasks compared to what was proposed in our project specification. Currently, up until week 7 we were supposed to work on the statistical model based on the advices given by Lachlan. Week 8 was spent mostly on the transition of our supervisors to get settled again. We will spend week 9 and 10 on implementing the Autoregressive Model to detect edges. We plan to spend week 11 in comparing our Machine Learning outputs vs Statistical Model outcomes, and also spend time in making the Poster and preparing for the presentation during that week. In week 12, we will be wrapping up by organizing our codes, the research outcomes, and start working on the Final Report. 

Below is the table summarizing our updated tentative timeline for the rest of the weeks:

| Task                                                          | Weeks  |
| --------------------------------------------------------------|:------:|
| Understanding and implementing Autoregressive Model           | 9 & 10 |
| Comparing Autoregression Model outcomes with previous results | 11     |
| Poster & Presentation preparation                             | 11     |
| Organizing Code, Outcomes and Final Report                    | 12     |

## Goals before next meeting
We plan to implement our first Machine Learning algorithm in the next two weeks.
