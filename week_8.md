# Week 8 Summary
We had our first meeting with Dr. Mahsa Salehi, our new Research Supervisor. While most of the meeting was explaining the current status of the project and the work we have been doing, we made plans for the next four weeks of the semester.

## Goals completed since last week
Our Statistical Model is finally complete with acceptable accurate results in most of the datasets provided, and hence we have considered the task of building a statistical model to detect edges to be complete.

## Research Conducted
Since we did not have any specific guidelines towards what we should be doing in week 8, very little work has been done on Research, and we spent most of our times doing assignments of other units. 

However, in our research meeting, which was at the end of the week, we sketched out an updated timeline of our tasks compared to what was proposed in our project specification. Currently, up until week 7 we were supposed to work on the statistical model based on the advices given by Lachlan. Week 8 was spent mostly on the transition of our supervisors to get settled again. We will spend week 9 and 10 on implementing an Autoregressive Model to detect edges. We plan to spend week 11 in comparing our Machine Learning outputs vs Statistical Model outcomes, and also spend time in making the Poster and preparing for the presentation during that week. In week 12, we will be wrapping up by organizing our codes, the research outcomes, and start working on the Final Report. 

Below is the table summarizing our updated tentative timeline for the rest of the weeks:

| Task          | Weeks           |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| AM            | 9 & 10        |


## Goals before next meeting
Our main goal next week is to settle with our new supervisor, to explain our progress and get new objectives in order to proceed our research. Since we already have successful outcomes through our statistical analysis, we will focus more on the Machine Learning part of our research. Based on our Project Specification, we will be conducting Machine Learning Techniques on the same dataset and try to obtain accurate results. We will then be spending the rest of the time in running tests to compare our statistical model vs Machine Learning in order to present the more accurate option to choose in our dataset.
